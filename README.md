# Welcome to the ENPKG Full Workflow!

üåü We're delighted to have you explore our computational workflow. This guide will walk you through the installation, setup, and execution of the ENPKG full workflow.
Interested in the science behind ENPKG? Check out our latest preprint (https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-sljbt-v2) ! It's packed with insights and methodologies that power this workflow.

## üå± Getting Started

### Install the required environment

Start your journey by setting up the required environment. It's a breeze (or not) with Mamba!

```bash
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

### Activate the environment

Once the environment is ready, bring it to life with this simple command:

```bash
conda activate enpkg_full
```

## üåê Install Sirius Locally


Check details at https://boecker-lab.github.io/docs.sirius.github.io/install/

To get the latest version for your platform, run the `install_sirius.sh` script specifying the path chosen for the installation. For example, from the root of the repository:

```bash
bash src/install_sirius.sh /home/username/sirius
```

Once Sirius is installed, you will need to precise the path to the executable see section [Editing config files](#editing-config-files).


## üîê Setting Up Environment Variables

Setting up the environment variables. To login to Sirius, you will need to set up the following environment variables (SIRIUS_USERNAME and SIRIUS_PASSWORD). You can do so launching the following command:

```bash
bash src/setup_sirius_env.sh
```


## üõ† Editing Config Files

You will need to edit the following parameters files:

- Parameters at [user.yaml](https://github.com/enpkg/enpkg_full/blob/c8e649290ee72f000c3385e7669b5da2215abad8/params/user.yml)

All parameters are commented and should be self-explanatory.


### E.g. selection of the dataset to process

For example you can enter the record_id and record_name of a Zenodo dataset on [line](https://github.com/enpkg/enpkg_full/blob/c8e649290ee72f000c3385e7669b5da2215abad8/params/user.yml#L8)
As it is set up here, this will download a small test dataset (https://zenodo.org/records/10018590/).

## üöÄ Launching the Workflow

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
sh workflow/00_workflow_all.sh
```

On the previous test dataset, this should take about 10 minutes to run.

## üéâ Explore your newly generated Knowledge Graph

You can use GraphDB to explore the generated Knowledge Graph. To do so, you will need to install GraphDB (https://graphdb.ontotext.com/download/) and import the generated .ttl files.
Make sure to read the latest Graph DB documentation (https://graphdb.ontotext.com/documentation/) to get started.


## üåü Your Feedback Matters

Facing an Issue? Encountering a glitch or have a suggestion? Your input is crucial for us. Here‚Äôs how you can help:

- Report Issues: Use the 'Issues' tab in our GitHub repo to report any problems or ideas.
- Detailed Descriptions Help: Include as much detail as possible - error messages, steps to reproduce, and screenshots are all super helpful.
- Stay Updated: We‚Äôll keep you in the loop as we work on fixing the issue or considering your suggestion.


## üîé Explore the ENPKG graph 

A Knowledge Graph, has been build on a collection of 1600 tropical plants extracts (https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giac124). This KG also integrates data from a metabolomics study led over 337 medicinal plants of the Korean Pharmacopeia (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01662-2). It can be explored following these links.

- The ENPKG graph is available at the following address https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/graphdb/. No need for login !
- The SPARQL research interface can be reached at https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/graphdb/sparql. Make sure to check the [preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-sljbt-v2) for examples of queries.
- The ENPKG vocabulary is described at https://enpkg.commons-lab.org/doc/index.html

## üìã Note

This workflow describes a pilot application aiming to transition from classical metabolomics datasets to [Linked Open Data](https://5stardata.info/en/) in such datasets. It is currently being ported to the more generic EMIKG framework (https://github.com/earth-metabolome-initiative/emikg) that we are developping in the frame of the Earth Metabolome Initiative (http://www.earthmetabolome.org/). Stay tuned.
